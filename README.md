# linx

A new way to connect local businesses and organizations.

## Getting Started

Use VSCode or Android Studio as your IDE and clone the repository.

From `main`, create your own branch in the format:
```
{ISSUE#}-{INITIALS}-{TITLE}
```

For the love of all things good, please do NOT push to main. I can't restrict this unless I give Github some $$.
